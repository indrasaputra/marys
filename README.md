Marys is a webhook to send message or notification to [Telegram](https://telegram.org/).
Marys is derived from one of [One Piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece) character: [The Marys](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Beasts_Pirates#Marys).
Its main purpose is currently as a notifier service for my personal projects.
